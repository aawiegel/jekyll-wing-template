# Dog breed recommendations

## Summary

Recently, my housemate decided to get a Siberian husky because it is a pretty dog. He didn't realize, though, that huskies are very social and incredibly active even compared to your typical dog. This temperament is not necessarily conducive to his lifestyle, so the situation has not been ideal for either him or the dog (or his house mates.) Based on this, I thought it would be a good idea to come up with a recommendation engine that suggests dogs based on both an image (appearance) and text description (temperament).

A rare moment where she is actually sitting still (getting a picture that wasn't a blur was the hardest part of this project.)

<br/>

To do this, I created vector representations (i.e., a column of numbers) of both a dog breed's appearance and temperament and combined them into one recommendation system. The representation of appearance came from a deep learning dog breed image classifier, and the representation of the temperament came from a dog breed topic model.  The resulting breed topic and image vectors were then compared to a user image and text to recommend the three most similar dogs. Purely appearance driven recommendations seemed to be more accurate but were not aggressive enough of labeling "not dog" images. Conversely, the text part was sometimes a bit off from data quality issues (some of the text I web scraped contradicted itself). Based on initial user feedback, I was able to improve the system's recommendations, To help improve the system in the future, I stored the user input in a database and solicited feedback on the quality of the recommendations and possible useful features. 

## Overview

Most people get dogs because they want something cute, but the personality and temperament of the dog is an important factor for successful adoption into a human family. For my housemate's husky, she is quite active and craves a lot of social attention since huskies were bred to hunt in packs by Siberian natives. In contrast, my housemate does not exercise much and leaves the house frequently. The dog thus spends a lot of time by herself outside, which predictably leads to neurotic and sometimes destructive behavior. This behavior leads to a cycle where the dog cannot be trusted unsupervised indoors, so she spends even more time by herself outside. For example, I awoke one time in the middle of the night to find the husky by herself chewing on my housemate's glasses! Another time she tore up a bag of corn tortillas and several bags of grains, leaving a mess throughout the entire house.

<!-- To help avoid this situation in the future, I developed a dog breed recommender using two models -->

<!-- trained via transfer learning with the convolutional neural network Xception and weights from ImageNet. For each of the 113 dog breeds included in the image data set, I took the average of the last layer for the images in the test set to create the appearance representations. The representation of temperament came from a dog breed topic model trained on text scraped from several different dog websites and Wikipedia. -->
