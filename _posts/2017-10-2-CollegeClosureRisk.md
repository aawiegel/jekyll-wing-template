# Overview

College and other forms of post-secondary education (like data science bootcamps!) are increasingly a necessary investment to obtain and maintain the competitive skills in the labor market. Furthermore, an educated populace is important so that civic society can properly evaluate the complex trade offs involved in various economic, social, and geopolitical issues. Given both its public and private value, the performance of universities and other post-secondary institutions should be evaluated to ensure that students are actually learning and not spending too much time playing beer pong and flip cup. (Although some is certainly a key socially formative experience for young adults!)

To exacerbate matters, tuition (after adjusting for inflation) has also increased precipitously in the last fifteen years or so see chart), often making the choice of college an agonizing one for all those involved.

To help give prospective students (and their parents) evaluate colleges before they apply and enroll, the Department of Education releases a College Scorecard that provides a quick summary of the performance and cost of different colleges. Here is an example of this report for the colleges near my zipcode.
